# Voyage-AI-Traveller-Segmentation
Unsupervised machine learning project to segment travellers based on behavioral data
# Voyage AI – Traveller Segmentation using Unsupervised Learning

## Problem Statement
Voyage AI is a data-driven travel analytics company that aims to understand user behaviour on its platform.
Travellers exhibit diverse booking and browsing patterns, and treating all users uniformly limits personalization
and targeted marketing opportunities.

## Objective
To segment travellers into meaningful groups using unsupervised machine learning techniques based on historical
travel behaviour data.

## Dataset Description
Each row represents a traveller and includes the following features:
- Trip Frequency
- Average Booking Value
- Destination Diversity
- Session Duration
- Search Count

## Methodology
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature scaling
3. K-Means clustering
4. Cluster evaluation using Elbow Method and Silhouette Score
5. Interpretation of traveller segments

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab
- GitHub

## Outcome
The project identifies distinct traveller segments that can be leveraged for personalized recommendations
and data-driven marketing strategies.
